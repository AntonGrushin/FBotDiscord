Greetings!

Our bot handles following commands:
```fix
AUTHORIZATION
```
__You can link your Warcraft account to your Discord. If you do so, you will be given ‘registered’ rank along with other that you deserve:__
*Champions – if you are in top 10,*
*Veteran – if you ever was in top 10,*
*Top50 – if you are in top 50.*
This will track all the changes as well.

If you want this, you need to authorize your account:
1.    Join Warcraft lobby channel of FBot (you can check current games here: http://bot.vofpro.com/ ) under account that you want to link.
2.    Type this command in game to get authorization code: 
```!getcode```
You will see private message with the code that you need to remember.
3.    Type retrieved code in #robot_spam channel. (You can do it in any other channel too, but your message will be deleted shortly after):
```!auth your_code```
Example:
```!auth 76Gty```
(This code is single-use, so don’t worry that someone will see it – he won’t be able to use it after you)
